- Ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues
- **Design Principles**
    - **Test recovery procedures** – Use automation to simulate different failures or to recreate scenarios that led to failures before
    - **Automatically recover from failure** – Anticipate and remediate failures before they occur
    - **Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability** – Distribute requests across multiple, smaller resources to ensure that they don’t share a common point of failure
    - **Stop guessing capacity** – Maintain the optimal level to satisfy demand without over or under provisioning – Use Auto Scaling
    - **Manage change in automation** – Use automation to make changes to infrastructure
