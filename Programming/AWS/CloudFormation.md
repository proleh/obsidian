It's a declarative way of outlining AWS Infrastructure.

Benefits:
1.  Infrastructure as code.
	1. No resources are manually created.
	2. Changed to the infrastructure are reviewed through code.
2. Productivity
	1. Ability to create and destroy on the fly.
	2. Automated generation of Diagrams.
	3. Declarative programming.
	4. Don't need to reinvent the wheel.
		1. Existing templates and documentation.
	5. Supports (almost) all AWS resources.(Custom resource can be used.)


Note:
1. Don't delete or update anything manually, instead update template or delete from CF to delete all that was generated from the file.
