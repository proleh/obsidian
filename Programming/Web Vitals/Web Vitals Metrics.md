- **INP (Interaction to Next Paint)** → Measures how quickly the page responds to user interactions (clicks, taps, key presses).
- **FCP (First Contentful Paint)** → Time until the first text or image is painted on the screen.
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)** → Measures how much the page layout unexpectedly shifts while loading.    
- **TTFB (Time to First Byte)** → Time from request to when the first byte of the response is received from the server.
- **TTI (Time to Interactive)** → Time until the page is fully interactive (can reliably respond to user input).
- **TBT (Total Blocking Time)** → Total time main thread was blocked (between FCP and TTI) preventing responsiveness.
- **FID (First Input Delay)** → Delay between the user’s first interaction and when the browser starts handling it.
